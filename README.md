# Task1.1-BlinkName

# SIT210 Embedded Systems 

* In this task we were required to set-up our arduino nano IOT using the arduino IDE
* We then were tasked with creating a program that blinks the on-board LED
* following this we used this knowledge to create another program which uses the on-board LED to blink our name in morse code
* lastly we built on this program to create a function for all letters of the alphabet so that you can call the functions to blink any name in morse code
* this program was written in C++ using the arduino IDE
